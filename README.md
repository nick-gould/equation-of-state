# equation-of-state
Using Python to solve thermodynamic cubic equations of state

Outline of what's available here:
* Setup of python classes for pure components and mixtures of components
* Building out a [Full-Factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_experiment) experiment for determining mole fractions of components based on Temperature and Pressure
* A simple neural network of the results using sklearn
